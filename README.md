# World-Happiness-Report-Analysis-in-ASEAN2024

This repository contains a Python Jupyter Notebook analyzing the World Happiness Report data, focusing on ASEAN countries.


## Data Source

The analysis uses the WHR2024.csv data file, which can be downloaded from Kaggle (link can be inserted here).


## Data Insights & Visualization


The notebook covers the following aspects:
  - Descriptive Statistics (Mean, Median, Mode) for all countries and ASEAN countries separately
  - Identifying top 10 and bottom 10 happiest countries
  - GDP per capita analysis for ASEAN countries including Thailand
  - Comparative bar charts of Ladder Score, Social Support, and GDP per capita in ASEAN countries.
  - GDP per capita of ASEAN countries
  - Standard Deviation for Ladder score and Healthy life expectancy
  - Correlation Analysis: GDP per capita vs. Ladder Score, Social support vs. Healthy life expectancy
  - Identifying countries with highest/lowest average Ladder score and Healthy life expectancy
  - Quartiles and IQR analysis of Ladder score and Healthy life expectancy
  - Visualization for ASEAN countries using line charts and box plots including:
    - Ladder score by country
    - GDP per capita by country
    - Perceptions of Corruption by country
    - Dystopia + Residual by country
    - Freedom to make life choices by country
    - Box plot of Healthy life expectancy by country


## Code Highlights

The notebook includes functions and code examples for:
  - Reading CSV data into pandas DataFrame
  - Calculating statistics
  - Creating comparative bar charts
  - Performing correlation analysis
  - Generating box plots


## Analysis Summary

The analysis reveals that Singapore has the highest Ladder score in ASEAN, potentially reflecting high quality of life and efficient social systems. Thailand demonstrates a moderate Ladder score compared to other ASEAN nations, alongside a higher GDP per capita. Countries with lower Ladder scores, such as Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, may have a link to economic, social, and political factors.

The visualizations highlight the disparities in happiness levels across ASEAN countries. These differences may be influenced by various economic, social, political, and cultural factors.

**Disclaimer:** It's important to note that the analysis presented here is based on readily available data and potentially does not cover all facets of the happiness and wellbeing of each country. Further in-depth exploration into specific countries would be required to gain deeper understanding of the underlying reasons for happiness disparities.
